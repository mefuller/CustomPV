Data and routines for designing laboratory pressure vessels

## Octave
Routines for Octave (mostly compatible with Matlab) developed in 2014-2015 were
utilized to design Shock Tube at Brown University (Goldsmith Laboratory).
The methods of calculation are drawn primarily from the ASME Boiler and Pressure vessel
code.

## Python
Someday maybe I will move these over to Python on an as-needed basis, perhaps
in conjunction with a larger effort with units and standards (screws, wire,
pipe). Who knows really?
